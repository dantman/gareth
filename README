== Requirements ==
* django
* south
* pytz
* pygments
* stomp.py

You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary modules at the last version we tested them with.

== Setup ==
# Create a settings file at gareth/settings_user.py; There is a settings_user-sample.py you can use as a base.
# If using sqlite ensure the directory the database will live in exists. Otherwise make sure the database and db user exists and has the necessary permissions.
# Run `./manage.py syncdb` to initialize the database
# Run `./manage.py migrate` to finish database setup
# You can run `./manage.py createuser -a {username} {password}` to create an admin user to login with
# For development you can run `./manage.py runserver` to start up a development server on localhost

== Developer quick install ==
The quickest pattern to try out Gareth or help out with it's development is to do this:
  # Clone Gareth and cd into the correct directory
  $ virtualenv .
  $ source bin/activate
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
  $ ./setupdev.py
  $ ./manage.py syncdb
  $ ./manage.py migrate
  $ ./manage.py createuser -a admin admin
  $ ./manage.py runserver

This will setup an isolated virtualenv. Install the packages necessary for Gareth. Install Gareth. Create an admin:admin user for you. And then start a webserver on localhost.
== CSS ==
Editing of css files should not be done directly. Instead anyone modifying css should edit the .scss files and be running `sass --watch garethweb/public`.
